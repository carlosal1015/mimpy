======================================

Mimpy is a Python based library for solving certain Partial Differential Equations using 
the Mimetic Finite Difference method. The code provides three main functions:

- Basic polyehdral mesh representation and processing. 
- Construction of Mimetic Finite Difference matrices. 
- Solution to sub-sufrace flow equations (Single-Phase flow, Two-Phase flow and the transport equation).
